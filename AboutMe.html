						<h3>I am a highly focused leader and problem-solver with a passion for community building and technology.</h3>
						<p>I graduated Cum Laude from Bentley University in May of 2020, having earned a Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems with a minor in Sociology, as well as the Outstanding Contribution Award for my class. I am a strong believer in the importance of hard work, strong personal relationships, and team building.</p>
						<p>This summer, I am starting my career as a Technology Development Program Associate at Optum. This rotational program will allow me to further hone my skills in project management, programming, and leadership. I look forward to working on multiple teams over the next year to provide intelligent technological solutions for the nation's largest healthcare company, Unitedhealth Group.</p>
						<p>In my free time, I enjoy spending time with my friends and cooking. As well as visiting my home state of Maine to see my family, sail, and explore nature.</p>
